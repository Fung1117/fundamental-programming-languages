Certainly! Here's a sample README.md file for the Notakto AI implementation:

# Notakto - AI

This project implements an artificial intelligence (AI) vs. human version of Notakto, a tic-tac-toe variant where the player who makes the last move loses. The AI acts as Player 1 and always starts the game. The goal of the AI is to force a win, regardless of how the human player plays.

## How to Play

1. Run the program.
1. The game board will be displayed, showing the positions marked with 'X' and the available positions.
1. The AI (Player 1) will automatically make a move by selecting a valid position on the board.
1. The updated board will be displayed.
1. The human player (Player 2) will be prompted to make their move by entering the position they wish to mark.
1. Steps 4-5 will be repeated until the game ends.
1. The game ends when either Player 1 or Player 2 wins.
1. The winning player will be displayed.

## Game Example

Here's an example of a game session:

```
A      B      C
0 1 2  0 1 2  0 1 2
3 4 5  3 4 5  3 4 5
6 7 8  6 7 8  6 7 8
Player 1: B0

A      B      C
0 1 2  X 1 2  0 1 2
3 4 5  3 4 5  3 4 5
6 7 8  6 7 8  6 7 8
Player 2: B3

A      B      C

Player 1 wins the game
```

## Winning Strategy

Player 1 (the AI) always plays optimally in order to force a win. It doesn't matter how Player 2 (the human player) plays; Player 1 will always win if it follows the optimal strategy. The AI makes its moves strategically to maintain the winning position.

## Performance and Optimization

The AI implementation is optimized for performance and speed. The AI is designed to make its move within a time threshold of 1 second per move. This ensures fast gameplay and responsiveness.

## Testing and Evaluation

To evaluate the AI's performance, a series of games will be played against an optimal AI. The AI must win all games to receive full marks. The testing process will ensure that the AI consistently follows the winning strategy and cannot be defeated by the human player.
