Certainly! Here's an example README.md file for the Connect Four game:

# Connect Four Game

This is a console-based implementation of the Connect Four game. The game allows two players, Player X and Player O, to take turns dropping their respective discs into a grid of cells. The objective of the game is to be the first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of their own discs.

## Game Rules

1. The game is played on a rectangular grid of cells.
1. Players take turns to drop their discs into any column of the grid.
1. A player's disc occupies the lowest available position within the chosen column.
1. Players cannot drop discs into columns that are already full (illegal move).
1. The game ends when one of the players forms a line of four discs horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
1. If all cells are occupied and no player has formed a line of four discs, the game is a draw.

## How to Play

1. Run the Connect Four program.
1. The program will prompt you to enter the dimensions of the game grid (number of rows and columns).
1. Enter 'y' if you want to play the standard game (6 rows and 7 columns), or 'n' to customize the grid size.
1. If you choose to customize the grid size, enter the number of rows and columns within the specified range.
1. The initial game grid will be displayed, with empty cells represented by dots ('·').
1. Players will take turns entering the column number where they want to drop their disc.
1. If a player enters an invalid column number or tries to drop a disc into a full column, they will be prompted again.
1. The game will continue until one of the players wins or the game ends in a draw.
1. If a player wins, the game will display "Player X has won!" or "Player O has won!" accordingly.
1. If the game ends in a draw, the game will display "Draw!".

Feel free to customize and enhance the game according to your needs!
