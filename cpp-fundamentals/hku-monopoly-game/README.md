# HKU-Monopoly-Game
Welcome to HKU Monopoly Game! This is a classic real-estate board game where the goal is to remain financially solvent by buying and developing pieces of property. The last player left in the game is the winner, achieved by forcing opponents into bankruptcy.

In this version of the game, we've replaced the traditional game board with a new board based on the map of HKU. You'll have the opportunity to buy and own various iconic HKU buildings, including the Main Building, the Centennial Campus, the Jockey Club Student Village III, and many more.

Watch out for exciting obstacles along the way, such as landing on properties owned by opponents or even getting sent to jail! But don't worry, second chances are available to keep you in the game.

Our game is programmed in C++, utilizing diverse data structures like maps and vectors to store game-specific and player-specific information. We've also implemented dynamic memory management and file input/output, allowing players to save and load their game progress.

Get ready to experience the thrill of owning and managing properties on the HKU campus in this immersive HKU Monopoly Game!
